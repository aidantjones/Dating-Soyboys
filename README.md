## Abstract

As more men attempt vegan or vegetarian (collectively referred to as
veg*) lifestyles, the historic link between meat and masculinity has
become more pronounced. Women tend to gravitate toward several traits
associated with veg* diets (e.g., compassion and health). However, the
emasculation associated with these diets may also repel them. 

This project utilized a mixed-methods analysis. It uses survey data (_N_
= 28) and in-depth, one-on-one interviews with six women who have dated
veg* men. I recruited subjects using convenience sampling from personal
social networks and veg* conferences. The present study explores whether
heterosexual and bisexual women are attracted to the masculinity of
vegan and vegetarian men more than their omnivore counterparts. 

Findings indicate that most women tend to view veg* diets as a masculine
strength and an indicator of kindness, a concept I dub strong-kindness.
With strong-kindness, this version of ideal masculinity moves a little
more into the feminine side while still remaining firmly within the
masculine part of the binary. Utilizing aspects of veg* lifestyles might
improve the health of all as well as the environment. Removing the
stigma associated with these lifestyles may help improve the lives of
all individuals regardless of gender identity.
